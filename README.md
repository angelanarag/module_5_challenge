Submitted by Angela Narag

The Module 5 Challenge will produce the following: 
1) Generate tables and figures needed for the technical report of the Pymaceuticals, Inc clinical study
2) Provide a top-level summary of the study results

Scenario: 
The Pymaceuticals, Inc clinical study compared the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens in regards to 249 mice with SCC tumors. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured.

The assignment is broken down into the following tasks:
1) Prepare the data.
2) Generate summary statistics.
    a. A row for each drug regimen. These regimen names should be contained in the index column.
    b. A column for each of the following statistics: mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of the tumor volume.
3) Create bar charts and pie charts.
    a. Two bar charts, one created with Pandas and the other with matplotlib - both show the total number of time points for all mice tested for each drug regimen throughout the study
    b. Two pie charts, one created with Pandas and the other with matplotlib - both show the distribution of female versus male mice in the study.
4) Calculate quartiles, find outliers, and create a box plot.
5) Create a line plot and a scatter plot.
6) Calculate correlation and regression.
7) Submit your final analysis.
